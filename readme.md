# Set Brightness for Windows## IntroductionOften times I am working on the computer and the brightness is too bright for my eyes.  This script will allow you to set the brightness level in Windows via a hotkey.It starts out at 100% brightness.  From there you use a hotkey `ALT+Shift+Down Arrow` to lower the brightness.  It will decrease the brightness of all monitors by steps of 10%.  You can raise the brightness by pressing `ALT+Shift+Up Arrow`.### Hotkeys:- Increase Brightness: `ALT+Shift+Up Arrow`- Decrease Brightness: `ALT+Shift+Down Arrow`
